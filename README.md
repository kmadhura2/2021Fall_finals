This proposal is for a type III project
In this project, we will be analyzing chronic respiratory diseases like asthma, influenza, pneumonia in the United States.

1) Hypothesis 1: Highly populated states are at the highest risk of getting asthma in the United States.
Description: We plan to create a metric for the factors that contribute to the risk of incubating asthma based on the severity of the cause. (We will consider high population and the effects of high population on air pollution, occupational exposures, indoor insulation, etc)
2) Hypothesis 2: We hypothesize that the incidence of COVID-19 has a relationship with mortality rates of other respiratory diseases, including pneumonia and influenza.
