The logic of the program was discussed and then the hypothesis was distributed.
Hypothesis-1 Madhura Kulkarni
Hypothesis-2 Himank Dave
The Future scope metric system was done by both the team members.

This proposal is for a type III project
In this project, we will be analyzing chronic respiratory diseases like asthma, influenza, pneumonia in the United States.

1) **Hypothesis 1**: Highly populated states are at the highest risk of getting asthma in the United States.
2) **Hypothesis 2**: We hypothesize that the incidence of COVID-19 has a relationship with mortality rates of other respiratory diseases, including pneumonia and influenza.
Hypothesis 1: Highly populated states are at the highest risk of getting asthma in the United States.
We began the analysis by understanding the relationship between Population and Asthma over the years for densely populated states and sparsely populated states. We plotted a time-series line graph and we conclude densely populated states and sparsely populate states give similar results and hence, no conclusion can be drawn from these graphs.

To proceed, we considered other factors such as Population Density, Smoking, Asthma and Air Pollution. The heatmap is plotted with no variance and considering as the independent factors. The heatmap shows that there is high correlation between all the variables except for the Population Density.
To investigate further, we plotted a correlation plot over the years. From this plot, we conclude that Smoking and Air Pollution has decreased over the years and Population, Population Density and Asthma has increased over the years.

Hypothesis 2: We hypothesize that the incidence of COVID-19 has a relationship with mortality rates of other respiratory diseases, including pneumonia and influenza.
We have used two datasets for this hypothesis, one is State Custom Data from 2017-2020 consisting of mortality data of influenza, pneumonia and COVID-19. Second Dataset is daily record of covid cases in US.
Our first aim is to find the relationship between COVID-19 mortality rates and other respiratory diseases.
Following are the graphs and their respective Heatmaps we found:

FINAL CONCLUSSION
From first four heatmaps and graphs we can say that Mortality rate of COVID-19 is related to other respiratory disease, thatâ€™s Pneumonia and Influenza, however no such relationship can be found in Incidence rate of COVID-19 and mortality rate of other respiratory disease.
