This proposal is for a type III project
In this project, we will be analyzing chronic respiratory diseases like asthma, influenza, pneumonia in the United States.

1) **Hypothesis 1**: Highly populated states are at the highest risk of getting asthma in the United States.
2) **Hypothesis 2**: We hypothesize that the incidence of COVID-19 has a relationship with mortality rates of other respiratory diseases, including pneumonia and influenza.


Hypothesis 2: We hypothesize that the incidence of COVID-19 has a relationship with mortality rates of other respiratory diseases, including pneumonia and influenza.
We have used two datasets for this hypothesis, one is State Custom Data from 2017-2020 consisting of mortality data of influenza, pneumonia and COVID-19. Second Dataset is daily record of covid cases in US.
Our first aim is to find the relationship between COVID-19 mortality rates and other respiratory diseases.
Following are the graphs and their respective Heatmaps we found:

FINAL CONCLUSSION
From first four heatmaps and graphs we can say that Mortality rate of COVID-19 is related to other respiratory disease, thatâ€™s Pneumonia and Influenza, however no such relationship can be found in Incidence rate of COVID-19 and mortality rate of other respiratory disease.

Work Contribution:
We have worked on it together on most parts such as finding datasets, in the beigning, resolving eachother's doubts and erros.

Himank Dave:
1.Created Data Merging python file to clean, and merge all datasets. Created Split function to split merged dataset based on years  
2.Contributed to Future Scope of Hypothesis 1, idea that builds the Metric and coding involved in it, Also the changes that were asked to make in it.
3.Complete Hypothesis. Finding Datasets, cleaning them and, created Mortality Function to compare mortality rates of various disease being studied
  Created Incident Rate fuction to calculate incidence rate of covid 19 and then comparing them with the other respiority disease also created a sub plot function to 
  plot all graphs involving that.
  
  Madhura Kulkarni:
  1. Helped in finding datasets for both Hypothesis 1 and 2.
  2. Created the if else conditions for the Hypothesis 1 Future Scope.
  3. Completed the Changes that were asked to make in Hypothesis 1 and created the Hypothesis.py file
